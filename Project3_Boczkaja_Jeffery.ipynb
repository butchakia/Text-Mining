       "\t■There are alternatives to the conventional strategy of drawing on a taxable </br>account first, followed by tax-deferred, and then Roth accounts. </br>\t■Many people can take advantage of income in a low tax bracket or tax-free </br>capital gains.</br>\t■If planning to leave an estate to heirs, consider which assets will ultimately </br>maximize the after-tax value. How to Get More Out of </br>Your Retirement Account </br>Withdrawals </br>These approaches can extend the life of your portfolio </br>and preserve assets for heirs.</br>Many people will rely largely </br>on Social Security benefits </br>and tax-deferred accounts </br>such as individual retirement accounts </br>(IRAs) and 401(k) plans to support </br>their lifestyle in retirement. However, </br>a sizable number of retirees will also </br>enter retirement with assets in taxable </br>accounts (such as brokerage accounts) </br>and Roth accounts. Deciding how </br>to use that combination of accounts </br>to fund spending is a decision </br>likely driven by tax consequences </br>because distributions or withdrawals </br>from the accounts have different tax </br>characteristics (see Figure 1  and </br>Appendix 1).</br>A commonly recommended approach, </br>which we’ll call “conventional wisdom,” </br>is to withdraw from taxable accounts </br>first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, </br>and, finally, Roth assets. There is some </br>logic to this approach:\t■If you draw from taxable accounts first, </br>your tax-advantaged accounts have </br>more time to grow tax-deferred.</br>\t■Leaving Roth assets until last provides </br>potential tax-free income for your heirs.</br>\t■It is relatively easy to implement.</br>Unfortunately, the conventional wisdom </br>approach may result in income that </br>is unnecessarily taxed at high rates. </br>In addition, this approach does not </br>consider the tax situations of both </br>retirees and their heirs. </br>This paper considers three objectives </br>retirees may have:</br>\t■Extending the life of their portfolio</br>\t■Having more after-tax money to spend </br>in retirement</br>\t■Bequeathing assets efficiently to </br>their heirs </br>Roger A.

For people </br>focused on the third objective—leaving </br>an estate—the withdrawal strategy can </br>include techniques to minimize taxes </br>across generations. </br>So what can investors do, and how can </br>advisors navigate these conversations? </br>We evaluated different withdrawal </br>strategies for a variety of situations and </br>summarized the key techniques for three </br>general scenarios (types of people). Our evaluation was based on assumptions </br>(page 16 ), key among them:</br>\t■Because the results depend so heavily </br>on federal taxes, we took into account </br>tax rules on Social Security benefits, </br>qualified dividends, long-term capital </br>gains (LTCG), and ordinary income. </br>See Appendix 1 for further discussion </br>of how these tax effects are interrelated.</br>\t■The household uses the married filing </br>jointly status and standard deduction.3 </br>State taxes and federal estate tax are </br>not considered.</br>\t■All taxable investment account </br>earnings are either qualified dividends </br>or long-term capital gains.4</br>1 Generally, owner is over age 59½ and Roth account has been open for at least 5 years.</br>2 Because these goals are similar, our analysis focuses on the longevity of the portfolio. Note, however, that the percentage improvement in spending </br>capacity may be lower than the improvement in longevity.</br>3 We used rates that were effective January 1, 2020. While federal tax rates are scheduled to revert to pre-2018 levels after 2025, those rates are not </br>reflected in the calculations. Inflation adjustments to brackets effective in 2021 do not significantly affect the analysis and, therefore, are not reflected.</br>4 This essentially assumes the account is invested in stocks or stock funds, an approach recommended in research on asset location, including: </br>Dammon, Robert M., Chester S. Spatt, and Harold H. Zhang. “Optimal Asset Location and Allocation With Taxable and Tax-Deferred Investing.” (2004). </br>The Journal of Finance 59 (3): 999–1037.

Those </br>who have done a solid job of saving </br>in different accounts can probably do </br>better than the conventional wisdom.</br>When following conventional wisdom, </br>you start by relying on Social Security and taxable account withdrawals. Since </br>some of that cash flow is not taxed, you </br>may find yourself paying little or no </br>federal income tax early in retirement </br>before required minimum distributions </br>(RMDs). That sounds great—but you may </br>be leaving some low-tax income “on the </br>table.” And then after RMDs kick in, you </br>may be paying more tax than necessary.</br>A better approach is to “fill up” a low </br>tax bracket with ordinary income from </br>tax-deferred account distributions. For </br>example, this income could fill the “0% </br>bracket,” where income is less than </br>deductions, or the 10% bracket. Any </br>spending need above those distributions </br>and Social Security can be met with </br>taxable account liquidations, followed by </br>Roth distributions.5</br>To illustrate this, Example 1 is a married </br>couple who can maintain their lifestyle </br>by spending $\n",

People Who </br>Expect to Leave an Estate</br>Goals: Maximize the after-tax </br>inheritance for heirs while meeting </br>lifetime spending needs </br>Strategies: Consider your heirs’ tax </br>situation to help prioritize tax-deferred or </br>Roth distributions; consider preserving </br>taxable assets for the step-up in basis</br>People who have accumulated </br>significant assets may have confidence </br>that they are unlikely to run out of money. </br>Therefore, they can plan a strategy </br>with their heirs in mind. These people </br>aren’t necessarily ultra-wealthy, but </br>they have been strong savers relative to </br>their income or spending. While these </br>households may have a relatively small </br>portion of assets in Roth accounts, </br>any Roth assets they do have can be </br>beneficial in planning.The first new strategy to employ involves </br>choosing between Roth and tax-deferred </br>distributions. When accumulating </br>assets, it usually makes sense to choose </br>between Roth and pretax contributions </br>based on whether you think your tax </br>rate will go up or down in retirement. </br>Similarly, to leave your heirs the largest </br>after-tax inheritance, consider their </br>potential tax rate. If it’s higher than yours, </br>it’s better to leave them Roth assets and </br>draw on tax-deferred assets for your </br>own spending.</br>Of course, there are some challenges </br>with implementing this approach. First, </br>it can be difficult to predict your heirs’ </br>taxes 30 years down the road. Second, </br>your own marginal tax rate can change </br>over the course of your retirement. That </br>said, if your heirs’ tax situation is even </br>somewhat predictable, it can be a factor </br>to consider.</br>The second strategy to consider is </br>preserving taxable assets. Under current </br>tax law, the cost basis for inherited </br>investments is the value at the owner’s </br>death. This is known as a “step-up” in </br>basis, and it effectively makes gains </br>during the original owner’s lifetime tax-</br>free for heirs. This can be a major benefit </br>for people with wealth that won’t be </br>spent in retirement.</br>There are four major factors that </br>determine the attractiveness of holding </br>taxable assets for the step-up compared </br>with preserving Roth assets:11</br>\t■Cost basis, as a percentage of value </br>(lower basis favors holding the taxable </br>investment), </br>\t■The tax rate on capital gains and </br>dividends (higher rate favors holding),</br>10 The percentage improvement in estate value depends largely on how close the portfolio is to running out. For example, the percentage improvement </br>after 30 years could be very large if the portfolio will run out by the end of 31 or 32 years. We show the percentage only if there is significant portfolio </br>life left, as in this case.</br>11 DiLellio and Ostrov. See Appendix 3 for details of this analysis, including how to evaluate a comparison with tax-deferred assets.People leaving </br>an estate should </br>consider holding </br>taxable assets so </br>their heirs get the </br>step-up in basis  </br>(and tax-free gains).</br>—  Roger Young, CFP® </br>Senior Financial Planner 7</br>\t■Life expectancy of the owner (holding </br>becomes more attractive closer to the </br>end of life), and</br>\t■The investment dividend rate (lower </br>dividend favors holding).</br>One tricky part about this decision is that </br>the capital gains tax rate depends on </br>your taxable income. Therefore, it can </br>change based on how you use different </br>accounts to meet spending needs. As </br>we discussed in the second scenario, </br>some people can take advantage of </br>untaxed capital gains, especially before </br>RMDs. To the extent gains are untaxed, </br>there is no benefit in holding those </br>assets for the step-up. Another caveat </br>is that we assume the same investment </br>returns for all accounts; if your low-basis </br>taxable investment has lower growth </br>potential or higher risk, holding it </br>obviously becomes less attractive.</br>For Example 3a, a couple with $2.5 </br>million in assets, we assume the heirs’ </br>tax rate is 10%—lower than the couple’s </br>marginal rate in most years. Because the </br>heirs’ tax rate is lower than the couple’s, </br>we aren’t in a hurry to drain the tax-</br>deferred account. We especially don’t </br>want to take tax-deferred distributions </br>if they push the couple into the 22% </br>bracket. Instead, the best method we found (shown in Figure 5 ) uses Roth </br>distributions in the early retirement years. </br>This illustrates three techniques, </br>including one from the second scenario </br>discussed earlier.</br>\t■At the beginning, Roth distributions </br>are used in combination with taxable </br>liquidations to keep taxable income </br>below the threshold for capital </br>gains taxes.</br>\t■After RMDs begin, it is preferable to </br>meet remaining spending needs with </br>Roth distributions, instead of elective </br>tax-deferred distributions, because of </br>the low heir tax rate.</br>\t■At that point, we also had another </br>decision—whether to preserve taxable </br>assets for the step-up. It turned out </br>that drawing down the Roth account </br>to preserve taxable assets was </br>favorable. However, after the Roth </br>account was depleted, it was better to </br>liquidate taxable assets than to take </br>elective tax-deferred distributions.</br>This method reduces taxes in the first </br>15 years of retirement (until the Roth </br>account is depleted) by \n",

       "years was more beneficial than taking </br>tax-deferred distributions to fill an </br>ordinary tax bracket. </br>\t■However, because of the high tax </br>rate on heirs, we then shifted to </br>tax-deferred distributions after RMDs </br>push taxable income above the capital </br>gains taxation threshold. </br>\t■Then, after the tax-deferred account </br>was depleted, we returned to a </br>combination of Roth distributions and </br>taxable liquidations (until the Roth </br>account is depleted). The level of </br>Roth distributions was chosen to keep taxable income below the threshold </br>for capital gains taxation, so those </br>gains are untaxed.</br>The key is that this method preserves </br>Roth and taxable assets for the </br>highly taxed heirs. It improves on the </br>conventional method by 3% for portfolio </br>longevity and by 8% for value to heirs at </br>age 95.</br>You’ll notice that this method incurs </br>significant taxes in years eight through </br>24.

       "The Setting Every Community Up for </br>Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) </br>Act of 2019 made several changes to </br>retirement savings, including two that </br>significantly affect withdrawal strategies:</br>\t■The starting age for RMDs has been </br>extended from 70½ to 72 (if you reach </br>70½ on or after January 1, 2020).</br>\t■The ability to stretch distributions from </br>Inherited IRAs and retirement plan </br>accounts over time has been limited. </br>Rather than taking RMDs over their </br>expected lifetime, most beneficiaries will </br>need to draw down the account fully </br>within 10 calendar years of the original </br>owner’s death. This does not apply to </br>some beneficiaries, such as spouses </br>and those who are less than 10 years </br>younger than the original owner.</br>The new RMD age gives retirees more </br>flexibility in developing a strategy. In </br>cases where a Roth conversion strategy </br>makes sense, there is now additional </br>time before RMDs to convert more </br>assets at a reasonable tax rate.</br>The limitation of “stretch” distributions </br>may have a more significant effect on </br>withdrawal strategies. A large inherited </br>tax-deferred account is more likely </br>than before to push a beneficiary into </br>a higher tax bracket. Therefore, it is </br>increasingly important to understand the </br>tax situation of potential beneficiaries. </br>This information can help you coordinate an estate plan and withdrawal strategy to </br>meet your goals:</br>\t■Consider leaving different types of </br>accounts to different beneficiaries </br>(e.g., Roth or taxable accounts to </br>higher-income children and tax-</br>deferred assets to others).</br>\t■Dividing retirement accounts among </br>several beneficiaries can reduce the risk </br>of higher taxes due to the 10-year rule.</br>\t■If higher tax rates for beneficiaries </br>are hard to avoid, factor those tax </br>rates into your withdrawal strategy. </br>As a result of the SECURE Act, more </br>households may benefit from a Roth </br>conversion strategy or one prioritizing </br>tax-deferred distributions (as illustrated </br>in Figure 6).</br>Each example in this paper assumes a </br>fixed income tax rate for heirs. Therefore, </br>the best strategies we identified did </br>not change from previous versions as </br>a result of the SECURE Act. However, </br>the SECURE Act may have a significant </br>effect on beneficiaries’ taxes that should </br>be taken into consideration.</br>Other Observations  </br>and Considerations</br>The examples we’ve shown highlight </br>the benefits of strategies for specific </br>situations. In addition to these examples </br>and techniques, retirees should consider </br>the following:</br>\t■If you have a significant portion </br>of assets in tax-deferred accounts </br>(as in all of our examples), RMDs </br>significantly limit your flexibility after </br>age 72 (if you reach age 70½ on </br>or after January 1, 2020). There </br>are several plausible examples (not </br>shown in this paper) where RMDs and </br>Social Security benefits completely </br>meet retirees’ spending needs. As a </br>result, retirees need to plan early and </br>take advantage of the pre-RMD years </br>for any of these strategies to have a </br>significant impact.It’s important to plan </br>before RMDs limit </br>your flexibility.</br>—  Roger Young, CFP®</br>Senior Financial Planner 10</br>\t■While we assumed retirement (and </br>Social Security claiming) at age 65, </br>the claiming decision should be </br>evaluated along with the withdrawal </br>strategy. There are benefits to delaying </br>claiming, including the fact that the </br>higher benefits are at least 15% </br>untaxed. Taxation is one of many </br>factors to consider, but life expectancy </br>and risk management are generally far </br>more important.</br>\t■The results and strategies in these </br>examples are sensitive to specific </br>assumptions, including asset level, </br>account mix, and spending needs. </br>Relatively small changes in those </br>assumptions could make the best </br>strategy different.</br>\t■We assumed all accounts have </br>the same investment return. In real </br>life, it is important to consider asset </br>allocation and location across the </br>accounts. Using the tax-deferred or </br>Roth accounts for rebalancing or </br>allocation changes, if possible, may </br>minimize tax-triggering events in the </br>taxable account.</br>\t■We assumed a fairly tax-efficient </br>taxable account composed of stocks </br>or stock funds. If your taxable account </br>includes investments such as bonds </br>that generate ordinary income, you </br>generally want to liquidate those </br>investments sooner. That makes the </br>point above about managing asset </br>allocation particularly important. </br>\t■State income taxes should also be </br>considered, but they may not be a </br>driving factor in your decision. Most </br>states exclude Social Security income, </br>and some exclude at least a part of </br>pension benefits or retirement account </br>distributions. Those provisions could </br>put you in a low state tax bracket in </br>retirement. That would make it slightly </br>more preferable for you to take tax-</br>deferred distributions if your heirs will </br>be subject to higher rates.\t■Taxes on different types of retirement </br>income are complicated and </br>interrelated. Therefore, we highly </br>recommend consulting with a tax </br>advisor or financial planner with </br>appropriate software. The software </br>could be specifically designed for this </br>purpose, but general tax software can </br>also help you evaluate the strategies.</br>\t■A surviving spouse may face higher </br>tax rates as a single filer than the </br>couple did. Couples should consider </br>health factors, age differences, and </br>expected income to assess this </br>risk. If the survivor’s tax burden </br>could be significant, bracket-filling </br>strategies early in retirement may be </br>advantageous. </br>\t■Remember that statutory rates can </br>also change and that the ordinary </br>tax rates we discuss in this paper </br>are scheduled to revert to pre-2018 </br>levels after 2025. The higher standard </br>deduction significantly improves </br>the feasibility of the 0% bracket and </br>untaxed capital gains strategies.</br>\t■We assumed constant spending (in </br>today’s dollars). To deal with major </br>changes in spending, such as major </br>purchases or medical expenses, a </br>borrowing source such as a home </br>equity line of credit may be useful. </br>That liquidity may enable you to avoid </br>large distributions or withdrawals that </br>would increase your tax rate.</br>\t■An advisor who can help you improve </br>upon the conventional wisdom </br>method is certainly adding value </br>through financial planning. However, </br>we’d characterize the improvement </br>we found in these examples as </br>incremental, not life-changing.  11</br>Conclusion\n",

       "Retirees,” DiLellio and Ostrov describe </br>formulas to compare the desirability of </br>using an account type for consumption </br>in retirement.

Therefore, if the taxable </br>desirability above is greater than 1, it is </br>preferable to liquidate taxable investments </br>rather than take Roth distributions.

Because you pay ordinary tax on </br>the conversion, prior research has shown </br>that the strategy is most advantageous </br>when the tax rate in the year of conversion </br>is significantly lower than the rate upon </br>distribution from tax-deferred accounts.17 </br>Conversions early in retirement can </br>reduce RMDs later and improve your tax </br>diversification. Our earlier research on </br>conversions found that the benefit may </br>also depend on the tax efficiency of the </br>account being used to pay the taxes on </br>the converted amount.18 If the taxable </br>account is fairly tax-efficient, the benefit </br>is smaller than if that account generated </br>significant ordinary income.19</br>In the scenarios we evaluated (including </br>many not discussed in this paper), Roth </br>conversions were sometimes beneficial, </br>but not overwhelmingly so. At lower </br>income levels, the potential benefit of </br>a conversion at a low tax rate is largely </br>negated by higher taxation of Social \n",
       "Security benefits. (See discussion of the </br>tax torpedo in Appendix 1.) Conversions </br>may be more beneficial at higher income </br>levels (e.g., reducing unneeded RMDs </br>taxed at 24% via Roth conversions taxed </br>at 12%). To a lesser extent, the modest </br>benefit of a Roth conversion reflects the </br>fact that we assume a relatively tax-efficient taxable account. In addition, to </br>implement a Roth conversion strategy </br>early in retirement, you need significant </br>taxable assets to pay the conversion tax </br>and fund spending.</br>Legislative changes since late 2017 have </br>affected the Roth conversion decision:</br>\t■Since tax rates were reduced but are </br>scheduled to increase after 2025, </br>conversions may be attractive in the </br>next few years.</br>\t■Limitations on stretch IRA strategies </br>may make Roth conversions appealing </br>to reduce taxes on beneficiaries.</br>\t■However, remember that you can no </br>longer recharacterize (“undo”) a Roth </br>conversion.</br>In general, you should consider Roth </br>conversions early in retirement if:</br>\t■You expect to leave an estate,</br>\t■You can comfortably afford the taxes </br>and fund your spending with cash or a </br>taxable account,</br>\t■Your unneeded RMDs will likely be </br>taxed at a much higher rate than the </br>one you’ll pay upon conversion, and</br>\t■Your heirs’ tax rate won’t be </br>significantly lower than yours.</br>17 Cook, Meyer, and Reichenstein.</br>18 Young, Roger. “When to Consider a Roth Conversion.” (2020).

Because </br>taxable gains are calculated based on </br>nominal returns (including inflation) </br>rather than real returns, we adjust the </br>cost basis for an assumed 3% inflation </br>rate each year. \t■Taxable investments pay a 1.5% </br>dividend annually as part of the real </br>return.

Taxable accounts are </br>valued at 95% of the value of Roth </br>accounts, as noted in Appendix 3. </br>\t■Scenarios were intended to reflect </br>reasonable Social Security benefits </br>relative to assets and spending </br>needs. In addition, scenarios were </br>built assuming that households with </br>lower preretirement income would </br>have relatively lower taxable portfolios, </br>whereas higher-income households </br>would have limited ability to build Roth </br>assets prior to retirement.
